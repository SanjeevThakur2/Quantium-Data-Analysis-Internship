# Quantium Data Analytics Program

Welcome to the Quantium Data Analytics Program README! This document provides an overview of the program, its objectives, and some key insights derived from the data analytics work conducted by our team. 

## Program Overview

At Quantium, we have established a long-standing data partnership with a major supermarket brand, allowing us access to transactional and customer data. As an analyst within the Quantium analytics team, your primary responsibility is to deliver valuable data analytics and insights that inform the strategic decisions of the business.

Supermarkets are dynamic environments that frequently adjust their store layouts, product selections, prices, and promotions to meet changing customer preferences and market competition.

## Key Insights

### Budget - Older Families

Promotions such as 'Buy Two Get One Free' can have a positive impact on sales by increasing the average purchase quantity, thus boosting overall revenue.

### Mainstream - Young Singles/Couples

To effectively target the Mainstream - Young Singles/Couples segment, consider the following strategies:

1. **Targeted Advertising:** Concentrate marketing efforts in areas with a high concentration of this segment, such as colleges and universities. Tailor advertisements to resonate with the preferences and lifestyles of young singles and couples.

2. **Strategic Placement:** Increase product visibility by placing items like chips alongside daily necessities commonly purchased by young individuals. This can capture their attention and lead to increased sales.

3. **Promotions and Repackaging:** Capitalize on the popularity of brands like Doritos and Pringles within this segment. Implement promotions and collaborate with manufacturers and suppliers to revamp packaging, incorporating vibrant colors and fonts that appeal to the youth demographic. This strategy can extend to both 150g and 134g chip sizes.

By combining these strategies, you can maximize their synergistic effects and better connect with the Mainstream - Young Singles/Couples segment, driving sales growth.

### Mainstream - Retirees

To effectively engage with the Mainstream - Retirees segment, consider the following strategies:

1. **Targeted Advertising:** Given the substantial customer base within this segment, targeted advertising remains a key strategy. Tailor your advertisements to appeal to the preferences and interests of retirees.

2. **Daytime Sales Promotions:** Recognize that retired customers are more likely to shop during daytime hours. Plan limited-time sales promotions during these hours, focusing on products that are popular within this segment. This approach can encourage higher sales when retirees are more active in stores.

By combining targeted advertising with daytime promotions, you can optimize your marketing efforts and cater to the specific needs and behaviors of the Mainstream - Retirees segment, ultimately boosting sales.

## Conclusion

We've successfully identified control stores 233, 155, and 237 to pair with trial stores 77, 86, and 88, respectively. Our analysis reveals compelling results: for trial stores 77 and 88, there is a substantial and statistically significant difference in sales during at least two of the three trial months. However, trial store 86 does not exhibit the same level of difference, potentially due to variations in trial implementation.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding, we may consult with the client to investigate any differences in the trial's execution at store 86. Overall, our analysis wrongly demonstrates a noteworthy increase in sales during the trial period.

With our analysis complete, we are ready to prepare our presentation for the Category Manager, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations.
